## Huffman-Coding

The Huffman-Coding is a smart way for compression and decompression.
It's used for lossless data compression.
For compression the algorithm counts the frequency of chars.
The higher the frequency of a char in the string the shorter is the sequence of bits which are used to represent the char.

## Example of a Huffman-Coding-Tree:
```
The Code will be created by the directions --------------------
  you had to follow to get to the char                         |
            |                                                  v
            |                                                Right -->
            |      ==============================Node===========================
            |    ||                                        /                    ||
            |    ||                                       /                     ||

        <- Left  vv                    This will get the code:                  vv

## Functions:

This package contains functions to compress and decompress a text.
Further it has some function to work with Huffman-Coding-Trees.
At least there are some function to encode and decode the types into sequences of bytes.
